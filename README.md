# P2PE
New panel-to-panel Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT) connection Finite Element (FE) model for cyclic behavior. This folder includes:
1. 3D co-rotational truss RE3 element 
2. 1D bar/spring E1 element
3. Modified Richard-Abbott (MRA) hysteretic timber model that simulates: asymmetry, pinching, degradation, and low-cycle fatigue of cyclic timber connections.

All FEs and the MRA model are available in FORTRAN77 codes adapted for ANSYS (tested that works) and MRA also in Python codes.
